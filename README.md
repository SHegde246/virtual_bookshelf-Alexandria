Virtual Bookshelf - Alexandria

django app : "bookshelf"

django project : "myproject"


Virtual bookshelf project in Django, where a user creates an account, and can simply browse or search for books from the dataset (based on preferred author, preferred genre, a combination of both, or title), view their summary, and add them to their shelf for later access. It comes in handy when the user is an avid reader, and they want a common place to store titles and summaries of books theyâ€™d like to read in the future
